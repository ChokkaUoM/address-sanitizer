#summary Compile-time optimizations for AddressSanitizer

=Introduction=
AddressSanitizer does not need to instrument all memory accesses to find all bugs.

The simplest example:
{{{
void inc(int *a) {
  (*a)++;
}
}}}
Here we have two memory accesses, load and store,
but we need to instrument only the first one.

Currently, we have very few optimizations implemented.
Your suggestions are welcome.
