#summary AddressSanitizer: a fast memory error detector

=Introduction=

Many tools for finding memory bugs exist. <BR>
[http://www.valgrind.org Valgrind], [http://code.google.com/p/drmemory/ DrMemory],
[http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Mudflap_Pointer_Debugging Mudflap], 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Fence  Electric Fence], Purify, Intel Inspector are among them. 
All these tools share the same problem -- they are slow. 

We propose a new tool called AddressSanitizer (*asan*) which finds 
*out-of-bound* and *use-after-free* bugs (a subset of bugs detectable by Valgrind).
The key advantage of this tool is that it is very fast (< 2x slowdown in most cases).
The tool consists of a compiler instrumentation module (currently, uses LLVM plugin)
and a run-time library which replaces the `malloc` function. 

The tool is in early stage of development but it already can run the Chromium browser (on Linux) and find bugs in it.
