#summary AddressSanitizer algorithm

=Short version=
The run-time library replaces the `malloc` and `free` functions.
The memory around malloc-ed regions (red zones) is poisoned. 
The `free`-ed memory is placed in quarantine and also poisoned.
Every memory access in the program is transformed by the compiler in the following way:

Before:
{{{
*a = 0;
}}}
After:
{{{
if (Poisoned(a) {
  GeneratePageFault(a);
}
*a = 0;
}}}

The tricky part is how to implement `Poisoned` very fast.
