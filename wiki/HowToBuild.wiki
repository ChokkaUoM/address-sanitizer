#summary Build Instructions for AddressSanitizer
The following will build the modified `clang` binary and run tests.
Getting and building LLVM/Clang will take some time.
{{{
svn checkout http://address-sanitizer.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ address-sanitizer
cd address-sanitizer
./llvm/get_clang.sh      # Slow. Do it only for the first time.
./llvm/unpatch_clang.sh  # Only if you are building again: remove the previous patch.
./llvm/patch_clang.sh    # Patch the llvm/clang sources.
./llvm/build_clang.sh    # Build clang.
cd asan                  
make -j                  # Build libasan{32,64}.a and the tests.
./bin_Linux/asan_test32 && ./bin_Linux/asan_test64  # Run the tests.
# Copy all required files into ../asan_clang_Linux
make install
# Build and run a tiny test.
../clang_build_Linux/Release+Asserts/bin/clang -O2 -g  -fasan tests/use-after-free.c && ./a.out
# Now you should see a report:
# READ of size 1 at 0x00002000005778c8; shadow: 0x00001000002bbc64; mem: 0x00000000015de325 thread T0
